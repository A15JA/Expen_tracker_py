# Expense Tracker

## Overview

The **Expense Tracker** is a Python-based application designed to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently. Built using **Tkinter**, **SQLite**, and **Matplotlib**, this project provides an intuitive graphical interface for tracking expenses, generating reports, and visualizing spending habits.

This project was developed as part of my **internship task at DataCrumbs**, where I worked on integrating **GUI development, database management, and data visualization** into a single application.
